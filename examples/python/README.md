# Python example that the C++ Python TTS library mimics

This example is a python script that does the same as the `linux` and `windows` examples. However it does not use the C++ Python TTS library. This is just to show how a python script looks compared to the C++ library.

## Setup Python

Install the requirements needed for the script:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r "<repo-root>/examples/python/requirements.txt"
```

## Run the test

Just run it like any other python script:

```bash
python3 "<repo-root>/examples/python/tts_test.py"
```
